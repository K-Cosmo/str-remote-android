0.2.1 extends the accepted 0.2.0 speaker-management baseline with:

- a more compact native Remote header;
- explicit and accessible saved-speaker Online/Offline presentation;
- persistent last-known reachability used while background validation runs;
- stable device-card layout during revalidation;
- native no-Wi-Fi guidance on both major app views;
- direct Android Wi-Fi settings access;
- endpoint-first reconnect/device-selection behavior before WebView presentation.

The existing app-private preferences store is extended with last-known reachability state; no new persistence dependency/model, permission, cloud service, analytics backend, playback/business logic, Gradle or AGP upgrade is introduced.

## 0.2.0 release

- clean debug build + lint + release assembly: PASS;
- GitHub Android CI green for the exact release source commit and release tag;
- signed APK built from clean committed source;
- APK Signature Scheme v2/v3 verification: PASS;

## Accepted product baseline

0.2.0 includes:

- finite Wi-Fi-aware STR discovery/recovery;
- persistent saved speakers and quick switching;
- built-in/custom room assignment;
- explicit room/delete device actions;
- manual-host fallback;
- current-device/room presentation and direct Remote return path;
- dismissible local device-management guidance;
- constrained STR WebView wrapper with no cloud/account/analytics backend.

Accepted build baseline:

- minSdk 26;
- compile/target API 37;
- AGP 9.4.1;
- Gradle 9.7.1;
- Java 25 Gradle runtime criteria;
- Java source/target 17.

## Documentation baseline

Post-0.2.0 documentation drift has been converged:

- `/doc` remains the only normative documentation;
- root duplicate changelog is removed;
- root privacy/contribution files are pointers rather than duplicate policy;
- current architecture, compatibility, blocker, privacy, security and test documents describe the accepted 0.2.0 baseline;
- historical build/spec/evidence records remain unchanged as dated snapshots.

`0.2.1` is the current accepted public release.
